Featured by Apple, [Curator](http://curator.co) is _the_ way to collect, organise and present your ideas. Originally available only on iPad and in portrait, I worked with the team to release a universal application for iOS 8.0 that supports iPhone and iPad in both portrait and landscape orientations.

To keep data in sync across devices, I designed and implemented a solution that allows users to pick up where they left off on each device.
