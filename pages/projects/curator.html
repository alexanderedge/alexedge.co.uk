[Curator](http://www.curator.co) is a fast and visual tool for collecting, organising and presenting your ideas. Originally made for use on iPad, I worked with the team to create a universal application for iOS 8 that supports iPhone and iPad in both portrait and landscape orientations.

Users can move seamlessly from working on iPad to presenting on iPhone by way of a custom sync solution built for Curator.

Curator was featured by Apple in "Best New Apps" in June 2015.
