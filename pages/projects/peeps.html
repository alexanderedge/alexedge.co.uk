[Peeps](http://www.peeps.im) lets you create selfie video chats with groups of friends. [Tom Cavill](https://twitter.com/tomcavill) and I released Peeps in July 2014, since then it has been featured by Apple and as App of the Week in ShortList magazine.

I developed both the iOS and server components of Peeps employing, among many other technologies, RestKit, Parse, [push notifications](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/), third-party SMS integration (Twilio and Nexmo), custom-built phone number verification, video compression and iOS 8 animation APIs. Recently, I have added ï£¿Watch support to Peeps using [WatchKit](https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/).

To date, approximately one-third of Peeps is written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

Peeps is available for free on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/peeps/id881444366?mt=8&uo=4&ct=portfolio&at=10lHPc).
