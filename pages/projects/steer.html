[Steer](http://www.steer.me) has a reputation for delivering first-class web development on-site training courses in London, so I was thrilled when they asked me to write and teach a syllabus for iOS development suitable for beginners.

I took three classes of up to ten students on a week-long journey, beginning with programming fundamentals and culminating in each writing an image sharing app from scratch.
